## 2. Implementation Overview

[cite_start]The solution is organized into three main parts[cite: 24, 40, 51], covering DNA representation, essential algorithms, and optimization/testing.

### [cite_start]Part A: DNA Representation and Basic Operations (40 marks) [cite: 24]

#### [cite_start]Question 1: DNA Data Structures (15 marks) [cite: 25]
[cite_start]A primary **`DNA` class** was implemented to manage nucleotide sequences[cite: 26]:
* [cite_start]**Storage:** Uses Python lists and dictionaries to store sequence data[cite: 26].
* [cite_start]**Validation:** Ensures sequence integrity by validating against the set $\{A, T, G, C\}$ (ensures only A, T, G, C nucleotides)[cite: 27].
* [cite_start]**Error Handling:** Invalid nucleotides are handled with appropriate error messages[cite: 29].
* [cite_start]**Methods:** Includes methods to calculate sequence length, nucleotide counting, and derive basic statistics[cite: 28].

#### [cite_start]Question 2: Nucleotide Counting and Analysis (12 marks) [cite: 30]
* [cite_start]**Counting:** Functions to count individual nucleotides in a DNA sequence[cite: 31].
* [cite_start]**Frequencies:** Calculation of nucleotide frequencies as percentages[cite: 32].
* [cite_start]**Reporting:** Generation of a comprehensive nucleotide analysis report[cite: 33].
* [cite_start]**Comparison:** Implemented a function to compare nucleotide composition between two sequences[cite: 34].

#### [cite_start]Question 3: String Manipulation for Genomics (13 marks) [cite: 35]
* [cite_start]**Case Conversion:** Algorithms for converting DNA sequences to uppercase/lowercase[cite: 36].
* [cite_start]**Cleaning:** Removal of non-nucleotide characters from sequences[cite: 37].
* [cite_start]**Codon Splitting:** Logic to split long sequences into codons (groups of 3)[cite: 38].
* [cite_start]**Merging:** Functionality to merge multiple DNA fragments into a single sequence[cite: 39].

### [cite_start]Part B: Essential DNA Algorithms (35 marks) [cite: 40]

#### [cite_start]Question 4: DNA Transcription (15 marks) [cite: 41]
[cite_start]A comprehensive transcription system that converts a DNA sequence into its corresponding RNA sequence ($\text{T} \rightarrow \text{U}$)[cite: 42].
* [cite_start]**Strand Handling:** Supports transcription for both coding and template strands[cite: 43].
* [cite_start]**Error Checking:** Robust error checking for handling invalid sequences[cite: 44].
* [cite_start]**Batch Processing:** Functionality for batch processing multiple sequences[cite: 45].

#### [cite_start]Question 5: Reverse Complement Generation (20 marks) [cite: 46]
A robust system for generating the reverse complement of a DNA sequence:
* [cite_start]**Core Logic:** Uses dictionary mapping for reverse complement generation[cite: 47].
* [cite_start]**Degeneracy:** Handles degenerate nucleotides (R, Y, S, W, K, M)[cite: 48].
* [cite_start]**Orientation:** Implements both $5' \rightarrow 3'$ and $3' \rightarrow 5'$ orientations[cite: 49].
